        <h3>About us</h3>
Cruxly is a first of a kind service that allows businesses to detect actionable intent in real-time in any communication, i.e., detect whether there is a question or request, a commitment or promise, an intent to purchase, like or dislike, etc., from the body of a message or post. The founders of Cruxly began with the problem of solving the actionable intent detection while facing their own email overload problem. They decided that the only way to find out such actionable messages is to actually analyze the content and grammar. Since then, what started as an automated agent in mobile devices to detect actionable messages has generalized to a broadly applicable real-time analytics framework for intent and event detection.

Cruxly founders are serial entrepreneurs from Boulder, Colorado. The team comprises passionate software and text analytics experts with special interest in speech act detection.
